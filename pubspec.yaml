# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - category_image_default.jpg
    - empty_cart.png
    - no_result.svg
    - empty.svg
    - wishlist.png
    - list.svg
    - shoppint_cart_empty.svg
    - colors.csv


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Black.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Raleway-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
